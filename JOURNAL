Today I started setting up the sampled data.  I had to create a new job that 
would pull the training data out of the MySQL database into a local file that we 
could write to.  

TODO: TrainingData and Deploy model have local changes that still need to be 
deployed.  These are the new options that take input and output files so that I 
don't need to hardcode paths anymore.

TODO: Need to deploy ml.jar which will contain domain independent ML code.  I'm 
starting to separate out funcationality to make reuse easier.

TODO: UpdateSteamDataset is probably broken in a lot of places.  Follow up to 
make sure that it works everywhere and things are still functioning properly.

Once these guys are all in place, then I can get back to the real task of trying 
out different algorithms.  Still not certain how to do matrix factorization when 
you have a new matrix at run time ~ i.e. you haven't seen the user in the 
training data.
